### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at First Cloud Journey is quite welcoming and supportive. FCJ team members are helpful when I face challenges, and they respond even beyond regular hours. The learning space is well-organized and comfortable, which allows me to concentrate better on studying AWS concepts.

I think adding more informal meetups or sharing sessions between participants would help strengthen connections and create better opportunities for exchanging experiences.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor offers detailed explanations and consistently encourages questions whenever something isn't clear. What I value most is the approach of letting me explore and troubleshoot AWS services independently before providing direct answers. This helps develop my problem-solving abilities.

The admin team handles documentation, schedules, and program logistics smoothly, which makes the whole experience more convenient and less stressful.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The program content connects well with my university studies, particularly in areas like systems architecture, networking fundamentals, and cloud infrastructure. Through FCJ, I gained hands-on exposure to AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and VPC in practical scenarios.

This experience reinforced my theoretical foundation while introducing me to real-world implementations that aren't typically covered in classroom settings.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The program offers valuable learning experiences in several areas:
* Familiarity with project collaboration and management approaches
* Development of teamwork capabilities through group activities
* Enhancement of analytical thinking when working with AWS architecture
* Improvement in technical communication and documentation skills

The mentor shared useful insights about cloud career paths, certification preparation strategies, and industry best practices that extend beyond the core curriculum.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The program maintains a constructive atmosphere where participants support each other's learning journey. Despite being a student intern, I felt welcomed and included in the community.

During group projects or when deadlines approached, everyone collaborated effectively, sharing knowledge and helping one another, which fostered a genuine sense of belonging.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The program provides comprehensive learning materials, consistent mentorship, a flexible study arrangement, and financial support that varies by program phase.

Access to internal AWS training sessions is particularly beneficial, offering practical knowledge that complements theoretical learning.
